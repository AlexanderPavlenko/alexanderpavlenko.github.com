      <description>Some time ago I discovered Manfred Max-Neef&amp;rsquo;s Fundamental human needs taxonomy:
 Unlike Maslow&amp;rsquo;s Hierarchy of Needs, which focuses on a hierarchy of psychological needs, Max-Neef talks about needs that are complementary, all of which are necessary to achieve satisfaction.
 Indeed, the Maslow&amp;rsquo;s hierarchy seems to me kind of opinionated and arbitrary.
If only the game was as simple as reaching the imaginary top, somewhere across the infinite ladder.</description>

      <description>I think it&amp;rsquo;s cool to be able to create various diagrams just by declaring them in plain text. The first tool which I was using is PlantUML. Then I discovered MermaidJS, which is nicely supported by Typora. It&amp;rsquo;s even possible to render diagrams in the supported browsers. This allows the interactive elements and nice stylings. The graph below is an attempt to visualize the data flow and feedback loops for some of my gadgets.</description>

      <description>There is already an article which sings praises to Ruby. And so does the author of Sonic Pi.
 Amazingly, the concept of programming is probably emerged along with the first musical machines. These days, I see how code becomes the universal language which gets ideas across when nothing else can. And the music is the code of feelings. Except when you have &amp;ldquo;amusia.&amp;rdquo;
Today I got curious to explore Sonic Pi and its integration with DAW via MIDI in particular.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s start by assuming a fictional character Carl who has a bunch of unimportant accounts, perhaps an email full of spam and an online store visited once few years ago. Carl uses the same credentials for each account, and the password is easy to remember â€“ it&amp;rsquo;s his birthday.
Today Carl needs to sign up on a really important website. From muscle memory, the first intention is to reuse the good old login/password.</description>
