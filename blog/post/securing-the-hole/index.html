      <p>Let&rsquo;s start by assuming a fictional character Carl who has a bunch of unimportant accounts, perhaps an email full of spam and on a used-once-years-ago online store. Carl uses the same credentials for each account, and the password is easy to remember – it&rsquo;s his birthday.</p>

<p>Today Carl needs to sign up on a really important website. From muscle memory, the first intention is to reuse the good old login/password. But what if it&rsquo;s not so secret anymore? <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">Have I Been Pwned</a> confirms his suspicion. Carl starts to consider his options:</p>

<ul>
<li>Make up a new password for each important account and remember it!</li>
<li>Nope, I don&rsquo;t want to remember passwords which must contain a capital number, two hieroglyphs, an unprintable symbol, and the hyperspace.</li>
<li>I can write down them on the piece of paper. With multiple carbon copies to store in different places in case I lose some and then will have to change all the passwords just in case.</li>
<li>Probably it&rsquo;s better to keep them encrypted and digital. Easy backups, fast copy-paste.</li>
<li>I can use <a href="https://keepass.info/">KeePass</a> and have a nice big encrypted database, readable even on an ancient mobile phone with J2ME, Carl! <br />
Still, it looks to me as an unnecessary risk to decrypt it all just to access a single secret. Computer, what do you think?</li>
<li>Computer says: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Privacy_Guard">GnuPG</a> + <a href="https://www.gopass.pw/">gopass</a></li>
<li>Cool. Secrets are separated into many small files for independent decryption. And if it&rsquo;s too command-liny, I can use the front-ends Iike <a href="https://qtpass.org/">QtPass</a> and <a href="https://github.com/zeapo/Android-Password-Store">Android Password Store</a></li>
<li>At last! All seems in order. <br />
But wait, what the fu&ndash; is this 2FA thing?</li>
<li>Oh noes, another password! It&rsquo;s generated by a website and shown to me only once to QR-scan or copy-paste into a special program. This master secret gets transformed into a continuous stream of 6-digit single-use passwords. New password each minute — impossibru to steal or brute-force! <br />
Still, it&rsquo;s as secure as a storage of the master secret.</li>
<li>Enters U2F. Master secret is generated by a special hardware device and stored only in it. Login can be as simple as a hardware button press! I can check <a href="https://dongleauth.info/">DongleAuth</a> to see morons who have no U2F support yet.</li>
<li>Such device may have multiple functions, including GnuPG encryption.</li>
<li>Unfortunately, the device can be broken or lost, as it&rsquo;s not embedded into my body yet. This means some backup authentication method or a paper backup of the master secret is still needed.</li>
</ul>

<p>That was a lot of considering and Carl decides to switch his attention to some other things. He hopes his notes would be of some use to fellow characters. Maybe they will even <a href="https://github.com/AlexanderPavlenko/alexanderpavlenko.github.com/issues/new">comment</a> on what to improve?</p>

<p>P.S. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/macos-update-undoes-apple-root-bug-patch/">Sometimes passwords are just not needed!</a></p>
