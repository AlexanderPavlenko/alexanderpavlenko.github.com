<p>Amazingly, <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/steven_johnson_how_play_leads_to_great_inventions">the concept of programming is probably emerged along with the first musical machines</a>. These days, I see how code becomes the universal language which gets ideas across when nothing else can. And the music is the code of feelings.<br>
Except when you have <a href="https://www.oliversacks.com/books-by-oliver-sacks/musicophilia/">&ldquo;amusia.&quot;</a></p>
<p>Today I got curious to explore Sonic Pi and its <a href="https://in-thread.sonic-pi.net/t/is-it-possible-to-control-via-sonic-pi-an-instrument-in-ableton/1878">integration with DAW via MIDI</a> in particular. This research was inspired by <a href="https://www.propellerheads.com/shop/rack-extension/drum-sequencer/">Propellerhead Sequencer</a>, and the goal was to implement a free analog on Ruby.<br>
<a href="https://github.com/AlexanderPavlenko/sonic-pi-works/blob/master/Sequencer.rb">The result was satisfying!</a></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>To render all these MIDI notes into the sound, I used <a href="https://www.propellerheads.com/en/reason">Propellerhead Reason</a>. It did help to create <a href="https://koshdukaimusicreason.blogspot.com/2015/09/generic-midi-channel-aware-remote.html">per-channel controllers</a> and assign them to the instruments via &ldquo;Surface locking.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="with-comfort-">With comfort</h2>
<p>Sonic Pi looks nice, but its code editor is not yet as powerful as a professional IDE. So I started my <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/">RubyMine</a>, and after a few edit-save-reload cycles, it became apparent that a bit more integration is needed. With a few <a href="https://in-thread.sonic-pi.net/t/buffer-autoreload-on-external-file-change-event/2075?u=alerticus">helpful hints</a> from the Sonic Pi community, I implemented a <a href="https://github.com/AlexanderPavlenko/sonic-pi-works/blob/master/autoreload.rb">reload function</a> which is triggered automatically when the file is saved. Also, I checked out Sonic Pi source code and extracted <a href="https://github.com/AlexanderPavlenko/sonic-pi-works/tree/master/stubs">documentation</a> from it. The <code>yard.rb</code> file, when placed into the project dir, does enable the smarts, like the code autocompletion, analysis, and instant help.</p>

<p>P.S. Sometimes writing code for fun is a nice break from writing code for a living!</p>
