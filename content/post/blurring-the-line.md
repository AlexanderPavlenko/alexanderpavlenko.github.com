"[The Left Hand of Darkness][]" is a novel published by Ursula K. Le Guin in 1969, featuring an anthropomorphic specie on another planet, where individuals do not have a fixed gender, instead undergoing periodic spontaneous change into male or female, while being asexual most of the time. And they can control this process by using hormones.

I wonder how this piece of science fiction correlates with the actual history: 

> Magnus Hirschfeld in 1918 at his Institute for Sexual Science in Berlin was one of the first to offer his patients the means to achieve sex change, either through hormone therapy, sex change operations, or both. [[Farah Naz Khan, 2016][history]]

Wow, it's going on for more than a century already!

Still, it doesn't yet seem to be fully acknowledged as a wondrous achievement serving the liberation of consciousness. It reminds me the Queen's "Innuendo" lyrics: "Just turn yourself into anything you think that you could ever be".

To be honest, I didn't think much about this topic before, dismissing it as something irrelevant to me. Which is kinda self-contradictory, because I like the Psychic TV's music and the [Wachowskis' movies][Sense8]. And now I also love the [Natalie Wynn's channel][ContraPoints], which is full of splendid characters, serious discussions, jokes and poetry.
