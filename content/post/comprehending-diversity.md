According to [this data][], the human homosexuality is still discriminated. But here is a somewhat shocking insight: the homosexuality phenomenon doesn't even break out of the binary gender system! 'Homo-' means 'same', 'hetero-' means 'opposite'. How can we start to comprehend [non-binary][] then?

Let's start from the biology. Gender binarism is obviously rooted in the reproduction process. But what if one cannot or [does not want][] to have an offspring? I guess, this doesn't make them any less human. They may even [wish to adopt some][]. And considering the ecological decline, just keeping on making more humans may propel "[the tragedy of the unregulated commons][]". But who cares for [this nerd stuff][]?

What do we even want? Play the sex chess? [Transition][] to the other side of the board? Flip the table and transgress?
