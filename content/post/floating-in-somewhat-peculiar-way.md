There is a very nice diagram in [this post][]: an "Everything We Know" sphere engulfed in a "Everything We Don't Know" cloud. It may evoke whole lot of somewhat Lovecraftian associations. Like we're inside a galaxy-sized body of knowledge. Maybe a symbiont, maybe a parasite gnawing its way towards a metamorphosis.
