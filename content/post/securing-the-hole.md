Let's start by assuming a fictional character Carl who has a bunch of unimportant accounts, perhaps an email full of spam and on a used-once-years-ago online store. Carl uses the same credentials for each account, and the password is easy to remember – it's his birthday.

Today Carl needs to sign up on a really important website. From muscle memory, the first intention is to reuse the good old login/password. But what if it's not so secret anymore? [Have I Been Pwned][0] confirms his suspicion. Carl starts to consider his options:

* Make up a new password for each important account and remember it!
* Nope, I don't want to remember passwords which must contain a capital number, two hieroglyphs, an unprintable symbol, and the hyperspace.
* I can write down them on the piece of paper. With multiple carbon copies to store in different places in case I lose some and then will have to change all the passwords just in case.
* Probably it's better to keep them encrypted and digital. Easy backups, fast copy-paste.
* I can use [KeePass][1] and have a nice big encrypted database, readable even on an ancient mobile phone with J2ME, Carl! \
Still, it looks to me as an unnecessary risk to decrypt it all just to access a single secret. Computer, what do you think?
* Computer says: [GnuPG][2] + [gopass][3]
* Cool. Secrets are separated into many small files for independent decryption. And if it's too command-liny, I can use the front-ends Iike [QtPass][4] and [Android Password Store][5]
* At last! All seems in order. \
But wait, what the fu-- is this 2FA thing?
* Oh noes, another password! It's generated by a website and shown to me only once to QR-scan or copy-paste into a special program. This master secret gets transformed into a continuous stream of 6-digit single-use passwords. New password each minute — impossibru to steal or brute-force! \
Still, it's as secure as a storage of the master secret.
* Enters U2F. Master secret is generated by a special hardware device and stored only in it. Login can be as simple as a hardware button press! I can check [DongleAuth][6] to see morons who have no U2F support yet.
* Such device may have multiple functions, including GnuPG encryption.
* Unfortunately, the device can be broken or lost, as it's not embedded into my body yet. This means some backup authentication method or a paper backup of the master secret is still needed.

That was a lot of considering and Carl decides to switch his attention to some other things. He hopes his notes would be of some use to fellow characters. Maybe they will even [comment][8] on what to improve?

P.S. [Sometimes passwords are just not needed!][7]
